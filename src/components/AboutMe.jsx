      <p>
        Hello my name is Shumaela Laeeq! I went to school at William Paterson University and majored in
        Psychology with a minor in Public Relations. I currently work as a Supervisor for a UK based
        fashion brand. After much research and recommendations I had decided for a career change. I love
        working on projects that require creativity and am excited in
        working towards a career in Web Development!
